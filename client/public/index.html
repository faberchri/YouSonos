      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      enables use of YouSonos icon if added to home screen (only tested on iOS)
      png (alo used as favicon) created with: http://cthedot.de/icongen/

      Using https://realfavicongenerator.net/ also tested but the chosen approach seems to work better at least on iOS,
      plus requires less additional image files.
